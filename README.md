Overview
This repository contains selected artifacts from the CS 300 course, showcasing my work in data structures and algorithms. The artifacts included here demonstrate my ability to analyze and implement efficient algorithms for managing and querying data, a crucial skill for any software engineer. The selected works highlight my understanding of runtime analysis, memory usage, and the application of appropriate data structures to solve specific programming problems.


1. Runtime and Memory Analysis (Project One)
Description: This document contains a detailed analysis of the runtime and memory usage for various data structures, including vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. It evaluates the efficiency of these structures in different scenarios and provides recommendations based on their performance.
Purpose: Understanding the trade-offs between different data structures is essential for optimizing software performance. This analysis demonstrates my ability to choose the right data structure based on the specific requirements of a problem.
2. Course List Sorting and Printing (Project Two)
Description: This C++ code is part of a program designed to assist academic advisors at ABC University. The code loads course data into a binary search tree, sorts the courses alphanumerically, and prints the sorted list. It is a practical example of implementing a data structure to manage and query data efficiently.
Purpose: This artifact showcases my ability to implement a data structure (binary search tree) and use it to solve a real-world problem. It highlights the importance of sorting and efficient data retrieval in software applications.


Reflection

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In these projects, I was tasked with solving the problem of efficiently managing and querying a large set of course data for a university’s academic advising system. The primary challenge was to implement a system that could quickly sort and retrieve course information, including prerequisites, using the most appropriate data structures.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
My approach began with a thorough analysis of the problem requirements and the selection of suitable data structures. Understanding data structures is fundamental because they directly impact the performance and scalability of software applications. For this project, I evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of various data structures—vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees—before choosing the binary search tree for its balanced performance in both data retrieval and sorting.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Throughout the project, I encountered several challenges, including handling edge cases like searching for non-existent courses and managing user input validation. I overcame these roadblocks by leveraging my professional experience and applying best practices in error handling and code design. This included thorough testing of each function and ensuring that the program could gracefully handle unexpected scenarios.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project has reinforced the importance of choosing the right data structure early in the design phase of software development. It has expanded my approach by emphasizing the need for thorough runtime analysis and considering how data will be accessed and manipulated. This project has also reminded me of the value of designing software that is not only functional but also efficient and scalable.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project has further developed my skills in writing maintainable and readable code. I’ve become more diligent in using clear, consistent naming conventions, adding meaningful comments, and structuring my code in a way that is easy to understand and modify. Additionally, the experience of working with different data structures has made me more conscious of the need to write adaptable code that can be easily extended or refactored as project requirements evolve.

Conclusion

This portfolio showcases my ability to apply data structures and algorithms to solve practical programming problems. It reflects my growth as a software engineer, particularly in the areas of problem-solving, code efficiency, and maintainability. As I continue my journey to complete my formal degree, I am confident that the skills and insights gained from these projects will greatly contribute to my future work in software development.
